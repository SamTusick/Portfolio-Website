                        I'm a software engineering student at Florida Gulf Coast University, originally from 
                        Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I became interested in software development through a mix 
                        of curiosity and a desire to create things that actually help people. Over time, I 
                        found myself drawn to artificial intelligence and machine learning â€” not just for the 
                        innovation, but for the potential to solve real-world problems in smarter ways. My goal 
                        is to build technology that's practical, human-centered, and meaningful beyond the screen.
